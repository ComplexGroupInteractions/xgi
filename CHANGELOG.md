# Changelog

## Current release
* Added the ability to convert to and from a NetworkX bipartite graph.
* Removed the `shape` property from `Hypergraph` and renamed the `number_of_nodes()` and `number_of_edges()` methods to the `num_nodes` and `num_edges` properties, respectively.
* Added random seed decorator as in NetworkX.
* Added a `SimplicialComplex` class.
* Added order and weighted arguments to the `incidence_matrix` and `adjacency_matrix functions`.
* Added an `intersection_profile` function.
* Added a `laplacian` function with argument `order` and a `multiorder_laplacian` function.
* Fix: Return an empty array rather than a 1x1 zero array when appropriate.
* Fix: Ensured that the incidence matrix is always has dimensions num_nodes x num_edges.
* Added 2 generators of random (maximal) simplicial complexes, and toy star-clique generator
* Extensively rewrote the documentation, updating the content and format on Read The Docs.
* Added an egonet function to get the edges neighboring a specified node.
* Added functions to visualize hypergraphs and simplicial complexes.
* Added the ability to get nodes and edges of given degrees/sizes respectively.
* Extended the `members()` function to be able to get different data types and to either get a single edge or all edges.
* Added the `load_xgi_data` function to load datasets from the xgi-data repository.
* Added two additional tutorials: a tutorial on visualizing higher-order networks and a case study replicating a recent paper.
* Changed the API of `degree_histogram` and added `degree_counts` based on #23.
* Refactored the `IDDegreeView` class and changed the API. Added the ability to specify `order` and the datatype.
* Added an abstract class `IDDict` to handle data validation.

## v0.2
* `H[attr]` now accesses hypergraph attributes
* `H.nodes[id]` now accesses attributes, not bipartite neighbors
* Removed the`__call__()` functionality from `H.nodes` and `H.edges`
* `H.nodes.memberships(id)` and `H.edges.members(id)` now access the bipartite neighbors
* Created base classes for the Node/Edge Views and Degree/Edge Size Views to inherit from.
* Removed the NodeDataView and EdgeDataView.
* Updated the list of developers
* `__getitem__()` in the NodeView and EdgeView are now in a try-except block for greater efficiency.
* Removed the name attribute and fixed methods and tests to match.
* Fixed the `erdos_renyi_hypergraph()`, `chung_lu_hypergraph()`, and `dcsbm_hypergraph()` methods such that the number of nodes will always match the number the user specifies, even if the resulting hypergraph is disconnected.
* Changed the construction method from reading in a Pandas DataFrame to using the `add_node_to_edge()` method for a 2x speedup.
* Added some basic unit tests for the generative models.
* Added the dual keyword for the read_bipartite_edgelist() method.
* Added small functions to the Hypergraph class
* Added generator of random hypergraph
* Added functions for finding and removing isolates
* Refactored the `has_edge()` method in the Hypergraph class.
