# Changelog

## Current release



## v0.2
* `H[attr]` now accesses hypergraph attributes
* `H.nodes[id]` now accesses attributes, not bipartite neighbors
* Removed the`__call__()` functionality from `H.nodes` and `H.edges`
* `H.nodes.memberships(id)` and `H.edges.members(id)` now access the bipartite neighbors
* Created base classes for the Node/Edge Views and Degree/Edge Size Views to inherit from.
* Removed the NodeDataView and EdgeDataView.
* Updated the list of developers
* `__getitem__()` in the NodeView and EdgeView are now in a try-except block for greater efficiency.
* Removed the name attribute and fixed methods and tests to match.
* Fixed the `erdos_renyi_hypergraph()`, `chung_lu_hypergraph()`, and `dcsbm_hypergraph()` methods such that the number of nodes will always match the number the user specifies, even if the resulting hypergraph is disconnected.
* Changed the construction method from reading in a Pandas DataFrame to using the `add_node_to_edge()` method for a 2x speedup.
* Added some basic unit tests for the generative models.
* Added the dual keyword for the read_bipartite_edgelist() method.
* Added small functions to the Hypergraph class
* Added generator of random hypergraph
* Added functions for finding and removing isolates
* Refactored the `has_edge()` method in the Hypergraph class.
